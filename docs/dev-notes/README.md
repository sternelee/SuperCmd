# Development Notes

This directory contains internal development notes and logs generated during the building of SuperCmd. They document design decisions, bug fixes, and UI iterations.

These files are kept for historical reference but are **not user-facing documentation**. For setup and usage instructions, see the main [README](../../README.md).
